## Welcome

In addition to being home to the source code of many websites within the University of Alabama, this organization also hosts core web projects used across the university. These projects include the university WordPress themes, templates, frameworks, and design systems.

Please note that all internal source content is restricted to members that have a paid seat in any organization within the [UA GitHub Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/ua). We're working on ways to surface information to people without access to GitHub, and we will always provide a copy of any critical information outside of GitHub. GitHub content may provide more detailed context or technical information, but is primarily used by the StratComm team and developer collaborators to cross reference project assets.

## Contributing

Please join our Web Forum on Microsoft Teams open to anyone in the UA community. This is where you can engage with developers, designers, and content cordinators working on web projects across the university. To see internal code projects, you must be a member of any organization within the UA GitHub Interprise. Stratcomm occasionally opens an application to distribute extra GitHub seats to developers on campus who would otherwise have no access.
